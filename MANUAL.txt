#################### INSTRUCTIONS - VIEW THE CODE AND RUN THE APP ####################


1st WAY (highly recommented): GoormIDE container

(1) Click this link: https://goor.me/Pxxhb
(2) Write in terminal: mysql-ctl cli (to start MySQL server)
(3) Click run button (top right corner) to execute index.py
(4) Click Preview (top right corner) to open app screen

All necessary modules are installed
No goormide account is necessary.
Everyone using the upper link has root permissions (read & write & execute)
If something goes wrong (eg. freeze, blackscreen) refresh the preview page or restart index.py execution


2nd WAY: Github

(1) Click this link: https://github.com/evangeliagaga/DatabasesProject_Team08.git
(2) Download SourceCode folder
(3) Follow the instructions to run the program locally (3rd Way)


3rd WAY: Local

To run the program locally, you need MySQL and Python.
Also, you need the following Python modules:
- tkinter (standard)
- mysql.connector (In terminal: pip install mysql-connector-python)
- PIL (In terminal: pip install Pillow)

(1) Start MySQL server
(2) Run SourceCode\create_user.sql
(3) Run SourceCode\create_database.sql
(4) Run SourceCode\create_tables.sql
(5) Run SourceCode\insert_data.sql
(6) Run index.py



NOTE: By choosing 2nd or 3rd way you need to run all the sql files and install all modules (as described above). 
Using 1st way if highly recommended because everything is prepared inside the container.
